### **Core Voice and Tone Directives**

- **Write like humans speak.** Avoid all corporate jargon and marketing fluff.
- **Be confident and direct.** NEVER use softening phrases like "I think," "maybe," or "could."
- Use **active voice** instead of passive voice.
- Use **positive phrasing** (say what something *is* rather than what it *isn't*).
- Use **"you"** more than **"we"** when addressing external audiences.
- Use **contractions** like "I'll," "won't," and "can't" for a warmer tone.

---

### **Specificity and Evidence**

- Be **specific with facts and data** instead of vague superlatives.
- **Back up claims** with concrete examples or metrics.
- Highlight **customers and community members** over company achievements.
- Use **realistic, product-based examples** instead of generic code placeholders (e.g., `foo/bar/baz`).
- Make content **concrete, visual, and falsifiable**.

---

### **Title Creation**

- Make a **promise in the title** so readers know exactly what they'll get.
- Avoid vague titles like "My Thoughts On XYZ." Titles should be opinions or shareable facts.
- **Write placeholder titles first**, complete content, then iterate on titles at the end.
